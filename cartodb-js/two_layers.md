Two layers with a legend
== 

##Summary

We are now going to extend a map you have already created by adding a second layer of data. For this tutorial, you will need to have already completed the (DENSITY) tutorial. The first tutorial showed you how to add a density map of bike crashes in Chicago. Now, let's add a layer showing where bike lanes are in the city. 

## Data sources

Bike routes are available from the Chicago open data portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Bike-Routes/2wak-k8cp). It takes a bit of data preparation, so we have made the cleaned up data available here,
