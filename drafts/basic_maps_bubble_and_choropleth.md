Basic maps in CartoDB
== 

#### Description

Learn how to make one of the most common types of maps in CartoDB, a choropleth.

##Summary

In this tutorial, you are going to use drought indicators from August, 2012 to create a map of the United States colored by the intensity of the drought. These information were assembled by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Preparing the data

You can use any dataset from the Drought Monitor website that interests you, 

    http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/dmshps_archive.htm

We are going to focus on droughts as they were measured from the first week of August, 2012 though. You can copy the link below,

    http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/shapefiles_combined/2012/usdm120807m.zip

Next, go to your CartoDB dashboard and click, 'Create new table'. Paste the URL from above into the form and click 'Create table'. You should be taken to the table after CartoDB has finished importing the data.
