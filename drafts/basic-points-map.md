This tutorial will walk you through the basics of CartoDB. It is meant for beginners looking to get started using the platform but are uncertain where to begin. It is also a good tutorial to read through if you just want to know some basic functionality when you are getting started. We will cover,

 - Where to find geospatial data

 - Uploading data

 - Removing unwanted rows

 - Creating a map

 - Sharing your map


## Finding Geospatial Data

Many people want to make maps with data but just don't know where to start. While ideally you can upload some of your own data to map, maybe you don't have it yet or need other data to make a more complete visualization. In those cases, it can be good to know a couple of places online to get good geospatial data. 

Here are a couple of our favorites

#### Natural Earth Data

http://www.naturalearthdata.com/

This is data for boarders, coastlines, cities, and many other great resources!

#### OpenStreetMap

http://www.openstreetmap.org/

Here you can get polygons for neighborhoods and cities, or roads and lampposts. 

#### Harvard Election Data Archive

http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/eda/

We use this one a lot. They keep a really fantastic resource of elections data for around the United States.

#### The Global Biodiversity Information Facility

http://data.gbif.org/welcome.htm

GBIF provides a portal to thousands of collections and millions of biodiversity records. If you want to map nature, there is no better place to start.
