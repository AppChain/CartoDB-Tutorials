Mapping OpenStreetMap data
== 

##Summary

You can find some really useful data at OpenStreetMap and we highly recommed that you support and even contribute to their project. OSM data can help you add roads, parks, buildings, and waterways to your map. We support OSM data import on CartoDB in a couple of different ways. First of all, you can query either the openstreetmap.org data portal for your area of interest, download the data and importer it to your account. Second, you can use one of the many mirrors that often keep small subsets of OSM data specific to areas of themes. Finally, you can use the portal to generate a URL for a specific area and import directly from that URL. Remember, OSM data can get quite large, so on free or small accounts, start by testing small areas. 

In this tutorial, we are going to show you how to select an area on the OpenStreetMap website map interfae, generate a URL to that area, and import that data to your CartoDB account. We will then show you how to run a few basic queries to filter that data.

## Downloading OSM data

Downloading OSM data is easy, for this tutorial we are going to make a quick map of the area around the great pyramids. To do so, first go to http://www.openstreetmap.org. Using the search tool on the left, type, Pyramid of Khafre and hit enter. The first matching result is the one we want, click on it. 

You should now be at an extremely zoomed in view of the pyramid! Zoom out 3 levels so that you get a bit more of the area in the map.
