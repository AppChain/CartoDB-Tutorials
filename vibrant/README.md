ViBRANT Workshop on data analysis and visualization using CartoDB
== 

We will be doing training and discussing techniques for analysis and visualization of data particularly in maps. As part of ViBRANt we have developed multiple visualization techiques and Open Source software that we will like to show you. The most important part is CartoDB, an Open Source Geospatial Database on the Cloud (www.cartodb.com). The workshop will use data, of course, from the Biodiversity Informatics community.

CartoDB is now being used by many users all around the world. On our community is used by projects like Map Of Life, Vertnet, Canadensys and by institutions like Yale, Harvard, Berkley, Columbia, Oxford and many more.
